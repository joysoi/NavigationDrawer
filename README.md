# NavigationDrawer
## Functionality
The navigation drawer is a panel that displays the appâ€™s main navigation options on the left edge of the screen. 
It is hidden most of the time, but is revealed when the user swipes a finger from the left edge of the screen or,
while at the top level of the app, the user touches the app icon in the action bar.
